### **How to make a KEYNOTE SPEAKING**

Considering the impact of Covid-19, we provide three ways to participate in the keynote speaking:

1. In-Person.
2. Pre-Recorded Video, with Live QA.
3. Live-Remote Speaking. (Please submit Pre-recorded video for disconnection accident)



### What we can offer

We understand that preparing every talk will consume your energy and time. Although we cannot provide the speaker fee because we are a non-profit organization and the conference is free to attend. We will offer your business round-trip tickets and accommodation during COSCUP. And you are also invited to join our welcome party on July 31 2021.



Please note that according to Taiwan epidemic prevention regulations, you must stay in the epidemic prevention hotel for 21 to 28 days. **COSCUP 2021 will not cover the cost of these 21 to 28 days for you**. (https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Category/Page/0vq8rsAob_9HCi5GQ5jH1Q)



If you are coming to Taiwan for COSCUP 2021, we recommend that you could stay for a few days after the conference to travel. Our epidemic prevention measures have kept the Taiwanese away from Covid-19, so you can travel with confidence, but you still need to follow the government's epidemic prevention principles.




Please let us know by **May 21** whether or not you’d be interested in speaking. Thank you for reading, and look forward to hearing from you.
